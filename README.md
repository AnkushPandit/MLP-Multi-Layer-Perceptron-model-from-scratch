# MLP-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-model-from-scratch
I built an MLP model from scratch in Python. I did not any standard ML tool or libraries like scikit-learn (Even though shuffle is used but it has nothing to do with the model) or tensorflow. This project demonstrates implementation of a simple MLP model using basic mathematics and matrix operations.
The input_plot.png file shows the diagram corresponding to the data points. You can understand that the datapoints are not linearly separable. So an MLP model is required for classification.
